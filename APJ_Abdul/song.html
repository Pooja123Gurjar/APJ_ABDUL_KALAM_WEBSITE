<h2>My Song</h2>
<p>
O Mother, Mother India,</br>
You have nursed us and grown us,</br>
And gave us a parting mission</br>
And an eternal message.</br></br>

â€œO my sons and daughters,</br>
Wherever you go,</br>
Whatever mission you do,</br>
Remember my children,</br>
My three advices golden!</br></br>

Always be truthful even in danger,</br>
Sweat and sweat to acquire,</br>
Knowledge and name,</br>
Wherever you live enrich that land.</br></br>

O, Mother we crossed the oceans and seas</br>
With many generation of yours with your blessings,</br>
We made new lands prosperous,</br>
We made knowledge as the way of life</br>
Sweat as the way of life and</br>
We give and give to honour you</br></br>

What we do is for honoring you,</br>
We will always be children yours,</br>
Wherever we are,</br>
Whatever we do,</br>
We will always be children yours!.</br>
O Mother, Mother India.</br>

</p>

<h2> Song Of Youth</h2>
<p>
As a young citizen of India, armed with technology, knowledge and love for my nation, I realize, small aim </br>
is a crime.</br>
I will work and sweat for a great vision, the vision of transforming India into a developed nation, powered </br>
by economic strength with value system</br>
I am one of the citizens of the billion; Only the vision will ignite the billion souls.</br>
It has entered into me ; The ignited soul compared to any resource is the most powerful resource on the</br>
 earth, above the earth and under the earth.</br>
I will keep the lamp of knowledge burning to achieve the vision - Developed India</br>
If we work and sweat for the great vision with ignited minds, the transformation leading to the birth of </br>
 vibrant developed India will happen.</br>
I pray the Almighty: "May the divine peace with beauty enter into our people; Happiness and good health </br>
blossom in our bodies, minds and souls".
